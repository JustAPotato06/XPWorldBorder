**XP World Border**

A plugin that combines every player's experience level with the size of the world border!

If the sum of all player's levels on the server is 15, the world border size will increase or decrease to 15 automatically.

How long can you and your friends survive?

**Current Features**

- All world borders across all dimensions and worlds increase and decrease according to the constantly updating levels of the players on the server
- If a player leaves the game while ouside the border in an attempt to evade death, they will be killed upon server rejoin!
- If a player leaves the game inside the border, but the border shrinks while they are gone, they will be teleported to the closest location that is inside the border
- The world border increasing and decreasing makes sound! There is a command to toggle either the increasing sound, decreasing sound, or both! Using */togglesound*

**Configuration**

Configuration is a big part of this plugin! Almost every feature is customizable, including:

- Plugin messages
- Whether the border updates when a player leaves (if not, levels are stored persistently)
- Whether the levels stored persistently are wiped after a period of time
- How long a player has to be offline for in order for their levels to be wiped and the border to be updated
- Whether or not players should be notified when an offline player's levels are wiped
- Whether or not the death message of every player should include how many levels they had
- Whether or not the amount of levels each player has should be displayed in the player list

**Upcoming Features**

- Going to make the speed of the world border increasing/decreasing configurable
- Going to create a countdown system that counts down from 10 once out of the world border and kills you if it reaches 0
- Going to make this countdown configurable (amount of seconds it counts down, whether it's on/off, etc.)
- Going to make whether or not players get teleported inside the border after they leave configurable
- Going to make whether or not players die after leaving while outside of the border configurable
